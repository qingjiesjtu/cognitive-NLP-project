1. how to set the value of necessities based on a real dialogue?

solution: 
identify words, by parsing for example, indicating necessities like "really" (20), "like" (10), "please" (15), "absolutely" (+-30)
"mustn't" (-30), "whatever" (0). (preference(_,-30))
-------------
but when analyzing dialogue on the fly:
the causal relation is hard to identify
as well as initial_situation() and action()


In short, combine parsing and argumentation.

@Qingjie : there is no "state of the art" on these topics 
(research on dialog is split among many avenues; you may have a look at the SIGDIAL conferences).

@Qingjie : necessity corresponds to multi-valued logics. 
It unifies beliefs and desires. Look at the BDI litterature if interested.

dialogue:
1. solve one problem
2. may have several subproblems, ranked by the preference
