# cognitive-NLP-project
* Adapted from the lab of argumentation of J-L. Dessalles, Telecom Paris.  
  
* Redefine a mini-knowledge base for a real dialogue:  
'''  
Son: Oh! It's raining heavily! But I have to go to school because I probably have an exam today.  
Mom: Yes, but you really need to be careful on the way. I really don't want to see you slipping. You'd better put on your rain boots.  
Son: The rain boots are not in good quality. I don't want my feet wet.  
Mom: How about taking a taxi?  
Son: I don't want it to be expensive to get to school.  
Mom: Ok, let your dad drive you there!  
'''

* Add the part to set necessities on the fly.

* To run the codes, just run main.pl and follow the instructions to set necessities on the fly.

* The program will provide the solutions of each conflict and it will finally give “dad_drives” as the best solution to attend an exam in the heavy rain.
